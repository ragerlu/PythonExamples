#Arithmetic: Operations based on arithmetic mathematic logic such as addition or subtraction.

#Addition:
1+1
#[2]

#Subtraction: 
1-1
#[0]

#Division:
2/1
#[2]

#Multiplication:
2*2
#[4]

#Exponent Evaluation (Both methods):
2**2
2^2
#[4]

#Boolean: A logical data type that can have only the values true or false. Involving this
#logic data type there is logic to be learned.

#Boolean Values:
True
False
#Now true can never equal false and false can never equal true. Think of these as a 
#1 and a 0.

#Logic operations for boolean evaluations:
#Greater than:
5 > 1
#Less than:
3 < 6
#Greater than or equal to:
1 >= 1
#Less than or equal to:
1 <= 2
#Equal to:
1 == 1
#Not equal to:
2 != 3
#And (Both):
True and True  
#Or (Both):
True or True 

#Examples of boolean operations are:
True != False
#[true]
5>3
#[true]
True == False
#[false]
